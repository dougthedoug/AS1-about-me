      <p>My name is Doug Armstrong and I am a student at Eastern Washington University in the Visual Communication Design program. I enjoy music, biking, hiking, and design. I was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, but I have an almost equal love for
        the eastern part of the state as well.</p>
